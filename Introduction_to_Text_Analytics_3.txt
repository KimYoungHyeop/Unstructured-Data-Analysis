<Text Analytics: Text Structures>

Structure of text data
- Data Mining / Knowledge Discorvery
    - Structured Data
    - Multimedia
    - Free Text
    - Hypertext

How Unstructured is "Unstructured"?
    - Weakly structured
        - Few structural cues to text based layout or makeups: research papers, legal memoranda, news stories, ets.
    - Semi-structured
        - Extensive format elements, metadata, field labels: E-mail, HTML/XML web pages, pdf files, etc.
Why is Text Mining Hard?
    - Language itself is ambiguous
        - Contexts is needed to clarify
        - Same word with different meanings, different words with same meaning
        - Misspellings, abbreviations, etc.

<Text Analytics: Types of Text Analytics>

Seven Types of Text Mining
    - Document Classification
        - Grouping and categorizing snippets, paragraphs, or document using data mining classification methods,
          based on models trained on labeled examples
    - Document Clustering
        - Grouping and categorizing terms, snippets, paragraphs or documents using data mining clustering methods
    - Concept Extraction
        - Grouping or words and phrases into semantically similar groups
    - Search and Information Retrieval(IR)
        - Storage and retrieval of text documents, including search engines and keyword search
    - Information Extraction(IE)
        - Identification and extraction of relevant facts and relationships from unstructured texts,
          The process of making structured data from unstructured and semi-structured texts
    - Web Mining
        - Data and text mining on the internet with a specific focus on the scale and
          Interconnectedness of the web
    - Natural Language Processing(NLP)
        - Low-level language processing and understanding tasks(e.g, tagging part of speech)
        - often used synonymously with computational linguistics
